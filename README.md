# Party Hard

An example of an application on Django.

## About application

This application allows us to invite friends from the social network vkontakte. The user who came to the page of the site will be offered to log in through the social network vkontakte. After authorization, if he has not previously responded to the invitation, it will be proposed to confirm or decline participation in the party. If he previously answered a question, he will be asked to delete and answer again. 

The party organizer can view all of these answers. Also, the organizer will receive email notifications about all actions of other users.
